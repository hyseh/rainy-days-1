## Description

In this project, you will find an online shop selling men's and women's rain jackets. This was one of my first projects using HTML and CSS. I added JavaScript and fixed a few issues later due to another project.

**Note:** This is a school project and I do not intend to keep it updated. Feel free to use any inspiration from this project if you want.
